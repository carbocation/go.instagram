go-instagram
============
* API to access Instagram data using golang. 

The goal of this package is to use concurrency 
where appropriate to enable responsive API access 
to Instagram. 

The programmer should be enabled to decide among 
various options: should Instagram take many seconds 
to respond, should the user wait? Should the user 
get a quick response that says that yields no results 
but explains the issue? The programmer can decide.

This golang Instagram binding, derived from kracekumar's 
original work, is still far from complete.
